3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given: string s,
Find: the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
substring: a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

longest and repeating keywords hint us that its a sliding window problem

[PROCESS (for result)]:

Given string: "abcabcbb"
Initialize 2 pointers variables for the sliding window
left_pointer = 0
right_pointer = 0

Initialize a dict to store the last seen index of each char
char_dict = {}

Initialize the variable to store the length of the longest substring
longest_substring_length = 0

Initial state:
"abcabcbb"
 ^
The window starts at index 0.

Iteration 1:
"abcabcbb"
  ^

The right pointer moves to the next character 'b'.
The character 'a' is added to char_dict with its index 0.

left_pointer = 0
right_pointer = 1
char_dict = {'a': 0}

Iteration 2:
"abcabcbb"
  ^
The right pointer moves to the next character 'c'.
The character 'b' is added to char_dict with its index 1.

left_pointer = 0
right_pointer = 2
char_dict = {'a': 0, 'b': 1}

... Continue iterating ...

Iteration 6:
"abcabcbb"
        ^
The right pointer moves to the next character 'b'.
Since 'b' is already in char_dict and its last seen index is >= left_pointer,
move the left pointer to the right of the last seen index (left_pointer = 3).
The character 'b' is updated in char_dict with its new index 6.

left_pointer = 3
right_pointer = 6
char_dict = {'a': 4, 'b': 6, 'c': 5}

Final result:
The longest substring without repeating characters is "abc" with a length of 3

'''
[SUMMARY]

Two pointers, left_pointer and right_pointer, are initialized at the start of the string s.
A dictionary, called char_dict, is initialized to store the last seen index of each character.
The variable longest_substring_length is initialized to 0.

Iteration:
The right_pointer iterates through the string from the start to the end.

For each character at the right_pointer:
If the character is already in char_dict 
and its last seen index is greater than or equal to left_pointer, 
move the left_pointer to the right of the last seen index.

Update the last seen index of the character in char_dict.

Update the length of the current substring if the current substring is longer.

Move the right_pointer to the next index.


Result:
The final result is the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
